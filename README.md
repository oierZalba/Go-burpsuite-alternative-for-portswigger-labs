# Go-burpsuite-intruder-alternative
This scripts programmed in the go language is an alternative to burpsuite intruder.

The first one is programmed specifically for the portswigger lab "2FA broken logic". 
The second one is programmed specifically for the portswigger lab "2FA bypass using a brute-force attack".
The second one is more complete.

The community edition of burpsuite, has the intruder very limited in terms of queries per second. This scripts in go would offer an alternative to the intruder by conveniently modifying the parameters of the script. Go is a very efficient programming language for http calls.
