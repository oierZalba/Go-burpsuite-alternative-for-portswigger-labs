# Go-burpsuite-intruder-alternative
This script programmed in the go language is an alternative to burpsuite intruder.

It is programmed specifically for the portswigger lab "2FA broken logic". The community edition of burpsuite, has the intruder very limited in terms of queries per second. This script in go would offer an alternative to the intruder by conveniently modifying the parameters of the script. Go is a very efficient programming language for http calls.
